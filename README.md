# Introduction

Machine learning is the study that allows computers to adaptively improve their performance with experience accumulated from the data observed. This series of courses would teach the most fundamental algorithmic, theoretical, and practical tools that any user of machine learning needs to know. This course focuses more on algorithmic tools and extends the fundamental tools in [Machine Learning Foundations](https://github.com/MichaelaTing/Machine-Learning-Foundations) to powerful and practical models in three directions, which include embedding numerous features, combining predictive features, and distilling hidden features.
